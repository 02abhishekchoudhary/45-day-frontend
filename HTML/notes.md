# HTML:

-> It is the most basic building block of the web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.
-> Hypertext refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.
-> HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images and other content for display in a web browser.

# ELEMENT:

-> An html element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consists of the element name surrounded by <>.
-> The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture.
-> For example the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, <TiTlE> or in any other way.
-> However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.
